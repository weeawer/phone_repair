# phone_repair
The text file contains records of phone repair orders. Each line contains information: application number, client number, full name of the master, time and date, phone ID, repair cost. A separate entity (class) stores information about phones handed over for repair: phone ID, brand, model, damage description, list of spare parts to be installed.
